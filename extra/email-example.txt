Hash: SHA1


There will be a PGP key-signing party held during the
Advanced Linux Users Meeting on Wednesday January 17,
2001 from 8:30pm to 9:00pm at the Market Street Pub 
in Gainesville, Florida.

Full details at:

What's a key-signing party?

A key-signing party is a get-together with PGP users for the purpose
of meeting other PGP users and signing each other's keys. This helps
to extend the "web of trust" to a great degree. Also, it sometimes
serves as a forum to discuss strong cryptography and related issues.

Required Items?

        1. Physical attendance
        2. Positive picture ID
        3. Your key ID, key type, HEX fingerprint, and key size
        4. A pen/pencil or whatever you'd like to write with....
        5. NO computer


Why should I use PGP?

You should use PGP, if you need (or want) to protect your personal
emails from being read by individuals or entities other than your
intended recipient(s). PGP, when used correctly, can provide message
privacy, message integrity, message authentication, and to some
degree non-repudibility.


OK. What are some good applications of PGP?

Protection of email traffic of a sensitive nature, such as the
coordination of response to ongoing security incidents, requests
for DNS modifications, requests for networking changes and exchange
of sensitive personal information like SSNs. At the very least, it
would be useful to have all such messages signed, so the recipients
could be sure that the notes were not forged.

in Gainesville are available from:

Please forward this note to anyone who may be interested in
attending.
