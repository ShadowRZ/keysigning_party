    PGP Keysigning parties are a get-together of PGP users for the
purpose of meeting other PGP users and signing each other's keys.
PGP is a form of encryption technology, similar to technologies used
in electronic commerce.  PGP Keysigning parties extend the "web of
trust", which is a form of infrastructure that PGP depends on to work
properly. PGP Keysigning parties are events which build infrastructure
for PGP communications and encourage the use of PGP. PGP technology
can produce digital signatures, preserve individual privacy, and help
to protect individuals on the internet from hackers.

    The Florida Linux Users (FLU) are a group of computer enthusiasts
who meet to promote and support people in the use and development of
the Linux OS.  FLU members include system administrators, publishers,
students, scientists, business people, and others. All share an
interest in varied aspects of the Linux OS.  FLU serves as a social
group discussing technology and as a support group for the discussion
and trouble-shooting of Linux and Linux related issues.  FLU currently
holds quarterly installation workshops to get new people up and running
Linux as quickly and as easily as possible. The group also has guest
speakers on a regular basis.

*Linux is a registered Trade Mark of Linus Torvalds.
